# LipSync-Video-Generation

This project provides an end-to-end pipeline for generating lip-synced videos where a person (2D/3D model or real) reads a given text with the most natural mouth movement possible.

- **`data/`**: This folder contains the dataset files which are extracted and ready for processing.
- **`models/`**: This folder stores pre-trained model checkpoints used for lip-sync generation.
- **`notebooks/`**: Contains the Jupyter or Colab notebooks that run the code for audio and video generation.
    - **`LipNet.ipynb: This notebook generates audio & video
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python package dependencies required to run the project.
- **`README.md`**: This file containing instructions for the project.
- **`LICENSE`**: License information for the project.

## Requirements

Make sure to install the following Python dependencies:

- `opencv-python`: For video processing
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization
- `imageio`: To handle video and image data
- `gdown`: For downloading data and models from Google Drive
- `tensorflow`: For building and training the deep learning model

To install these dependencies, you can use the `requirements.txt` file:
``bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
## How to Run the Code

Use gdown to download the pre-trained models and dataset.

First, make sure gdown is installed:
pip install gdown
gdown <link_to_the_data_or_model>

* Run the Notebooks
Run Jupyter Notebooks:

LipNet.ipynb: This notebook generates audio & video

* Test and Evaluate the Model
Once the notebooks are executed, you can test and evaluate the model by providing your own video/image as input. The model will then generate a lip-synced video with the provided audio.
