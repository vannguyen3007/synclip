# LipSync-Video-Generation

This project provides an end-to-end pipeline for generating lip-synced videos where a person (2D/3D model or real) reads a given text with the most natural mouth movement possible.

## Requirements

Make sure to install the following Python dependencies:

- `opencv-python`: For video processing
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization
- `imageio`: To handle video and image data
- `gdown`: For downloading data and models from Google Drive
- `tensorflow`: For building and training the deep learning model

To install these dependencies, you can use the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Download the Required Models and Data
Use gdown to download the pre-trained models and dataset.

First, make sure gdown is installed:
